## Introduction to Programming
### What is programming?
At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do. When you write a program, you create a step by step recipe of what needs to be done to complete a task and when your computer executes the program it reads what you wrote and follows your instructions to the letter.  

In a human language, __**syntax** is the rules for how a sentence is constructed__ while __**semantics** refers to the actual meaning of the statements__.
In a programming language, __the **syntax** is the rules for how each instruction is written__ and __the **semantics** is the effects the instructions have__.  

|   | Syntax | Semantic |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Human Language | the rules for how a sentence is constructed | refers to the actual meaning of the statements |
| Programming Language | the rules for how each instruction is written | the effects the instructions have |

What's the difference between a script and a program?  
* Scripts as programs with a short development cycle that can be created and deployed rapidly. In other words, a script is a program that is short, simple, and can be written very quickly.

### What is automation?
Automation is the process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically.

The benefits of autmation includes:
* Allowing people to concentrate on more complex, creative, or difficult tasks
* Consistency

However, some tasks that may require a degree of creativity or flexibility that automatic systems can't provide or for more complicated or less frequently executed tasks creating the automation may actually be more effort or cost than it's worth.

### Getting Computers to Work for You
Tasks performed by a computer that need to be done multiple times with little variation are really well suited for automation.

Automation:
* Helps avoid the possibility of human errors
* Reduces the time it takes to do perfrom tasks

## Introduction To Python
### What is Python?
Python is a general purpose scripting language.

Benefits of using Python includes programming in Python usually feels similar to using a human language.

In programming, an interpreter is the program that reads and executes code. The Python interpreter is the program that reads what is in the recipe and translates it into instructions for your computer to follow.

### Other Languages
There are different programming languages. Also, there are platform-specific scripting languages like PowerShell which is used on Windows, and Bash which is used on Linux. Each programming languages has its advantages and disadvantages.

## Hello World
### Hello, World!
* Functions in Python are pieces of code that performs a unit of work
* Kewwords in PyThon are reserved words tha are used to construct instruction
* The print function in Python outputs messages to the screen.
    * The print function wraps text in quotation marks indicates that the text is considered a string, which means it's text that will be manipulated by our script.
