# Using Python to Interact with the Operating System - Week 4

## Data Streams
### Reading Data Interactively
Use **input function** to prpmpt the user for a certain value which can be used in a script.

### Standard Streams
**I/O streams** are the basic mechanism for performing input and output operations in your programs.

Most operating systems supply three different I/O streams by default each with a different purpose which aren't restricted to just Python.
* STDIN - the standard input stream which is a channel between a program and a source of input
* STDOUT - the standard output stream which is a pathway between a program and a target of output
* SDTERR - the standard error stream which displays output like standard out, but is used specifically as a channel to show error messages and diagnostics from the program
